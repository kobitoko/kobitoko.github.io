use portfolio entries in markdown. and site dynamically loads them, into the boxes and the full page when selected.
And the inside content of each portfolio item, loads up a box that replaces content and is a closable window too (or pressing esc).

for tabulators:

problem with tabulator, it gotta load EVERYTHING, potential waste of loading other pages.
Keep the content divs empty kinda and load actual content from external html using js/jquery?
